<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Nicole Frumkin, a 24-year-old electrical engineering student in my 4th year at Tel Aviv University. I've always been passionate about technology and problem-solving, and I'm now exploring full-stack development to expand my skills.</p>
  <p>I have experience in low-level programming in C, as well as Python and Linux. I enjoy working on hands-on projects, from system-level programming to web development.</p>  
  <p>On this site, you can view my projects and see what I've been working on. Feel free to reach out - I'm always excited to connect and learn! </p>
